This repository contains the data and replication code for a paper examining the effect of union strength on employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) adoption. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, the paper estimates the causal impact of right-to-work (RTW) laws on union strength and ESOP formation across U.S. states.

The full paper can be found at the link here.
